# Directory Overview

This directory is an Obsidian vault. Obsidian is a personal knowledge base and note-taking application. This vault is intended to be used with the "obsidian-git" community plugin, which allows for syncing the vault's contents to a GitHub repository.

The vault is structured with several top-level directories to organize notes and attachments:
*   `1️⃣-Index/`: Likely for index notes or maps of content.
*   `2️⃣-Drafts/`: For work-in-progress notes.
*   `3️⃣-Plugins/`: Potentially for notes about plugins.
*   `4️⃣-Attachements/`: For attachments and other files.
*   `assets/`: The configured folder for attachments like images.

# Key Files

    *   `app.json`: Contains vault-specific settings.
    *   `community-plugins.json`: Lists the installed community plugins. Currently, `obsidian-git` is installed.
*   `help_obsidian_md/llms.txt`: A comprehensive guide on using Obsidian, from basic to advanced features. This can be a useful reference.
*   `Welcome.md`: The default welcome note from Obsidian.
