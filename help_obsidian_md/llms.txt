# Obsidian Help Documentation

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base application that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. This repository contains the official help documentation for Obsidian, covering everything from basic note-taking to advanced features like plugins, sync, and publishing. The documentation is organized into comprehensive guides that help users understand how to use Obsidian effectively for personal knowledge management, with support for linking notes, customizing the interface, and extending functionality through plugins.

The help site is built using Markdown files that demonstrate Obsidian's own features in action. Each documentation file covers specific aspects of Obsidian, from getting started guides to detailed API references. The documentation includes guides for core features like linking notes with wiki-style double brackets, organizing information with properties and tags, creating visual canvases, and using advanced search operators. It also covers Obsidian's paid services including Sync for multi-device synchronization and Publish for hosting public knowledge bases.

## Installation and Setup

Download and install Obsidian on your platform

The installation process varies by operating system but follows a consistent pattern of downloading the installer and running it.

```bash
# Windows - Download Universal installer

## Vault Management

Create and manage Obsidian vaults

A vault is a folder on your local file system where Obsidian stores your notes. You can create multiple vaults for different purposes.

```markdown
<!-- Creating a new vault -->
1. Launch Obsidian
2. Click "Create new vault"
3. Enter vault name: "My Knowledge Base"
4. Choose location: ~/Documents/ObsidianVaults/
5. Click "Create"

<!-- Opening an existing folder as a vault -->
1. Launch Obsidian
2. Click "Open folder as vault"
3. Navigate to folder: ~/Documents/MyNotes/
4. Click "Open"

<!-- Vault structure -->
MyVault/
├── .obsidian/              # Configuration folder
│   ├── app.json            # App settings
│   ├── appearance.json     # Theme settings
│   ├── community-plugins.json
│   ├── core-plugins.json
│   └── workspace.json      # Layout settings
├── Daily Notes/
├── Projects/
└── Notes/
```

## Creating and Linking Notes

Create notes with internal links using wikilink syntax

Obsidian's core strength is linking notes together to build a knowledge graph. The double bracket syntax creates links between notes.

```markdown
<!-- Create a note by typing -->
# Three Laws of Motion

The laws of motion are three laws stated by [[Isaac Newton]],
that describe the relationship between the motion of an object,
and the forces acting on it.

## First Law - [[Law of Inertia]]
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion
stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.

## Second Law - [[F = ma]]
The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the
object and the amount of force applied.

## Third Law - [[Action and Reaction]]
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

<!-- Links to non-existent notes appear dimmed -->
<!-- Click while holding Ctrl/Cmd to follow link -->
<!-- Click dimmed link to create the note -->

<!-- Alternative Markdown link syntax -->
[Three laws of motion](Three%20laws%20of%20motion.md)

<!-- Link to headings -->
[[Three Laws of Motion#First Law]]

<!-- Link with custom display text -->
[[Three Laws of Motion|Newton's Laws]]

<!-- Embed notes inline -->
![[Law of Inertia]]
```

## Markdown Formatting Syntax

Format notes using Obsidian-flavored Markdown

Obsidian supports standard Markdown plus extensions for better note-taking.

```markdown
<!-- Headers -->
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

<!-- Text formatting -->
**Bold text**
*Italic text*
==Highlighted text==
~~Strikethrough text~~

<!-- Lists -->
- Unordered list item
- Another item
  - Nested item

1. Ordered list
2. Second item
   1. Nested ordered

<!-- Task lists -->
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [?] Custom checkbox

<!-- Code blocks with syntax highlighting -->
```javascript
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

<!-- Inline code -->
Use `backticks` for inline code

<!-- Blockquotes -->

## Properties and Metadata

Add structured metadata to notes using properties

Properties (formerly YAML frontmatter) allow you to attach structured data to notes for filtering, sorting, and querying.

```markdown
---
title: Project Alpha
status: in-progress
tags: [project, important]
created: 2024-01-15
due: 2024-03-01
team: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
budget: 50000
archived: false
link: "[[Related Project]]"
---

# Project Alpha

<!-- Property types available -->
---
text_field: Simple text value
number_field: 42
checkbox_field: true
date_field: 2024-01-15
datetime_field: 2024-01-15T14:30:00
list_field:
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  - Item 3
tags_field: [tag1, tag2]
link_field: "[[Another Note]]"
links_list:
  - "[[Note 1]]"
  - "[[Note 2]]"
---

<!-- Add property via command -->
Cmd/Ctrl + ; → Add file property

<!-- Search by properties -->
# In search bar:
[status]                    # Files with status property
[status:in-progress]        # Files where status is in-progress
[status:Draft OR Published] # Multiple values
[budget:>10000]            # Numeric comparison
[archived:false]           # Boolean values
```

## Search and Query

Advanced search with operators and filters

Obsidian's search supports complex queries with operators, regex, and property filters.

```markdown
<!-- Basic search -->
meeting work              # Files containing both words
meeting OR work          # Files containing either word

<!-- Exclude terms -->
meeting -work            # Contains meeting but not work
meeting -(work meetup)   # Contains meeting but not both work and meetup

<!-- Exact phrases -->
"star wars"              # Exact phrase match
"they said \"hello\""    # Escaped quotes within phrase

<!-- Search operators -->
file:.jpg                      # Files with .jpg in filename
path:"Daily notes/2024"        # Files in specific path
content:"happy cat"            # Text in content only
tag:#work                      # Files with #work tag
match-case:ImportantWord       # Case-sensitive search
line:(mix flour)               # Lines containing both words
block:(dog cat)                # Same block contains both
section:(dog cat)              # Same section contains both
task:call                      # Tasks containing "call"
task-todo:call                 # Uncompleted tasks
task-done:call                 # Completed tasks

<!-- Property search -->
[aliases]                      # Has aliases property
[aliases:Name]                 # Specific alias value
[status:Draft OR Published]    # Multiple property values

<!-- Regular expressions -->
/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}/           # Matches dates like 2024-01-15
path:/\d{4}-\d{2}/            # Date in file path

<!-- Complex queries with grouping -->
meeting (work OR meetup) personal
(tag:#project OR tag:#urgent) -tag:#archived

<!-- Embed search in notes -->
```query
tag:#important status:active
```
```

## Bases - Database Views

Create database-like views of notes with filtering and sorting

Bases allow you to view and manage notes as structured databases with multiple view types.

```markdown
<!-- Embed a base in a note -->
```base
view: table
from: "Projects"
where: status = "active"
columns:
  - name
  - status
  - due_date
  - priority
sort: due_date asc
```

<!-- Base file format (.base) -->
```yaml
name: Active Projects
views:
  - name: Table View
    type: table
    from: '"Projects"'
    where: 'status = "active"'
    columns:
      - file.name
      - status
      - due_date
      - priority
    sort:
      - field: due_date
        order: asc

  - name: Cards View
    type: cards
    from: '"Projects"'
    image: cover_image
    title: file.name
    subtitle: status

  - name: Map View
    type: map
    from: '"Travel"'
    latitude: lat
    longitude: lon
```

<!-- Base query examples -->
```base
# List all tasks due this week
view: list
from: ""
where: task = true AND due_date >= today() AND due_date <= today() + 7d

# Table of team members
view: table
from: "Team"
columns:
  - name
  - role
  - email
  - department
sort: name asc

# Card gallery of book notes
view: cards
from: "Books"
where: status = "read"
image: cover
```

```markdown
<!-- Create new canvas -->
Command Palette → "Canvas: Create new canvas"
# Or right-click folder → New canvas

<!-- Canvas file format (.canvas) -->
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "node1",
      "type": "text",
      "text": "# Central Idea\n\nThis is a text card",
      "x": 0,
