In a real-world scenario with air resistance, the lead ball will reach the ground first. This is because air resistance has a much greater effect on the feather due to its larger surface area and lighter weight compared to the lead ball.

In a vacuum (no air resistance), both the lead ball and the feather would reach the ground at the same time. This is because the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects, regardless of their mass or shape, in the absence of air resistance.
